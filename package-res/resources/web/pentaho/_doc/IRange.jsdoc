/**
 * A range represents an interval on an underlying, base, ordinal domain.
 * It denotes a subset of a base domain.
 *
 * It is defined by the minimum and maximum values on that domain.
 *
 * When one of the limits of the interval is not defined, it is said that that limit is _open_,
 * and its property's value should be `undefined` (or be absent).
 *
 * When both of the limits of the interval are not defined, they are both _open_,
 * and their properties' values should be `undefined` (or both be absent).
 * This is an open range.
 * When the base domain is empty, this is the only valid range that can exist.
 *
 * When both of the limits are defined,
 * the minimum must not be greater than the maximum.
 *
 * @example
 * var closedRange = {min: 100, max: 200};
 *
 * var openRange1 = {min: undefined, max: undefined};
 * var openRange2 = {};
 *
 * var minOpenRange1 = {min: undefined, max: 200};
 * var minOpenRange2 = {max: 200};
 *
 * var maxOpenRange1 = {min: 100, max: undefined};
 * var maxOpenRange2 = {min: 100};
 *

 * @interface
 * @property {T|undefined} [min] The minimum value, or `undefined`, when minimum-open.
 * @property {T|undefined} [max] The maximum value, or `undefined`, when maximum-open.
